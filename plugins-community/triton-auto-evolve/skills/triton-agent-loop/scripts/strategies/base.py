"""Abstract base class for optimization direction/baseline strategies.

A strategy encapsulates three decision points of the optimization loop:
1. Which direction to try next (select_next_direction / select_next_round).
2. Which historical round to use as baseline (score_baseline_for_direction).
3. How to label the outcome of a direction attempt (classify_direction_yield).

New algorithms are added by subclassing Strategy and placing the module in
this package. The loader discovers them automatically.
